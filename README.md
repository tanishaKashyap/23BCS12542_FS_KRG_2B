# Portfolio Website  

This project is a personal portfolio website developed using **HTML and CSS**.  
It is designed with a clean and light theme to give a professional look while maintaining simplicity.  

The portfolio provides a structured overview of my background, including sections on skills, education, projects, extracurricular activities, and achievements.  
It also contains direct links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles for easy professional networking.  

This website serves as a digital representation of my work, academic journey, and technical expertise.
